Hi `code-server` template repo maintainer,

Thanks for requesting to register your `code-server` sample
image/template! Our humans will look onto it soon in order for your
`cdrs-deploy.repohubdev.tk` links on README and the guides section to
be active.

## Any additional steps?

Reply with `@RecapTimeBot register owner/repo` where `owner/repo` is your
GitHub repo link with the `https://github.com/` part.

That command will automatically generate an new issue in the [cdrs-deploy repo](https://github.com/code-server-boilerplates/cdrs-deploy.repohubdev.tk/issues)
for you.
